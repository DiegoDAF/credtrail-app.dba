# Self-Hosted Docker Runbook

This runbook covers institutional self-host deployment for CredTrail using Docker, Postgres, and
S3-compatible object storage.

## Runtime Profile

- API runtime: Node (`apps/api-worker/src/node-server.ts`)
- Queue worker: Node polling process (`apps/api-worker/src/node-worker.ts`)
- Database: Postgres 14+
- Object storage: an existing AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2 bucket
- Production installs must run with `APP_ENV=production`. The Docker image defaults to
  production, and the reference compose stack sets `APP_ENV=production`.

## Required Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `S3_BUCKET`
- `S3_REGION` (the AWS bucket region, or `auto` for R2)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `PLATFORM_DOMAIN`
- `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN` (the public app origin, including `https://` and any non-default port)
- `APP_ENV`
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (stable, high-entropy secret; rotate only with a session reset plan)
- `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated public origins allowed to use hosted auth)
- `PORT`

Optional:

- `S3_ENDPOINT` (required for R2; leave empty for AWS S3)
- `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` (defaults to `false`)
- `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` (comma-separated IPv4/IPv6 addresses or CIDRs; empty by default)
- `JOB_PROCESSOR_TOKEN`
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER` (`ses` for AWS SES, or omit to disable outbound email)
- `AWS_SES_REGION` (defaults to `S3_REGION` if omitted)
- `TRANSACTIONAL_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` (required when `EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses`)
- `AWS_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET`

Worker notes:

- The worker process runs the same queue-processing route logic in-process.
- Configure worker containers with the same DB/storage credentials and production auth secret as
  the API container. Runtime identity is assigned by the Node factory, not an environment override.
- Production Node API and worker use pooled `DATABASE_URL` connections. The Cloudflare Worker
  runtime continues to require Hyperdrive in production. Missing Node `DATABASE_URL` fails startup.

## Configure Docker Compose

The default Compose stack runs database migrations and starts the API and queue worker. It connects
to the Postgres database you specify in `DATABASE_URL`, such as AWS RDS or another managed service.
An optional Compose file adds local Postgres. Credentials and artwork are stored in your S3 or R2
bucket. Create a private bucket before starting the stack; Compose does not create or manage it.

From the app repository, copy the settings template:

```bash
cp .env.selfhost.example .env.selfhost
```

Edit `.env.selfhost` on your machine. This file is gitignored and excluded from Docker builds.
Enter your database URL, bucket settings, and credentials there; keep them out of commits, issue
reports, and chat messages.

### Connect to managed Postgres

Set `DATABASE_URL` to your provider's connection URL. Use the same database for migrations, the API,
and the worker; Compose passes this value to all three. The database must exist, and the database
user must have permission to apply the schema migrations. URL-encode special characters in the
username and password.

Use certificate-verified TLS for managed databases. A provider with a publicly trusted certificate
can use a URL ending in `?sslmode=verify-full`.

For AWS RDS, create a `.local` directory and download the appropriate
[RDS CA certificate bundle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html)
to `.local/rds-ca.pem`. Use the RDS endpoint hostname in the URL so certificate verification can
check its identity. Add these query parameters to your URL:

```text
?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=/run/credtrail/database-ca.pem
```

The certificate path refers to a file inside each container. Create `.local/compose.database-tls.yml`
with this content to mount the downloaded certificate read-only:

```yaml
x-database-tls: &database_tls
  volumes:
    - type: bind
      source: ./.local/rds-ca.pem
      target: /run/credtrail/database-ca.pem
      read_only: true
      bind:
        create_host_path: false

services:
  migrate:
    <<: *database_tls
  app:
    <<: *database_tls
  worker:
    <<: *database_tls
```

Allow the Docker host to reach the database through your network and database security rules.
For RDS, run the host in a network that can reach the instance and allow its connections in the RDS
security group. See [RDS PostgreSQL TLS connections](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.SSL.html).

### Configure object storage

For AWS S3, use the bucket's region and leave `S3_ENDPOINT` empty:

```dotenv
S3_BUCKET=your-credtrail-bucket
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_ENDPOINT=
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=false
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
```

Give the AWS identity access to check the bucket and read, write, and delete objects:
`s3:ListBucket` on the bucket, and `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, and `s3:DeleteObject` on its objects.
Keep the bucket private; CredTrail serves public credential and artwork URLs through the app.

For Cloudflare R2, use `auto` as the region and the S3 API endpoint from your bucket's dashboard:

```dotenv
S3_BUCKET=your-credtrail-bucket
S3_REGION=auto
S3_ENDPOINT=https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=false
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-r2-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-r2-secret-access-key
```

Create an R2 API token with **Object Read & Write** access restricted to this bucket. Use its S3
Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. See [R2 authentication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/tokens/)
and the [R2 SDK configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/examples/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/).

### Start with managed Postgres

Start the default stack with your local settings:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.selfhost -f docker-compose.selfhost.yml up --build --wait
```

If you created the RDS certificate mount file, include it in the command:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.selfhost -f docker-compose.selfhost.yml \
  -f .local/compose.database-tls.yml up --build --wait
```

Migrations must finish successfully before the API and worker start. The API becomes healthy when
the database and bucket are reachable. Missing database or bucket settings stop Compose with a
message naming the value to supply.

No `JOB_PROCESSOR_TOKEN` is needed for this stack. The API and queue worker use the packaged
Node bundles, and the worker processes jobs directly against Postgres.

To stop the default stack, run the same Compose command with `down` instead of `up --build --wait`.
Compose does not delete your managed database or external bucket, including when you use
`down --volumes`. Use your providers' database and bucket backup procedures.

### Optional: start with local Postgres

For local validation, set this URL in `.env.selfhost`:

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=postgres://credtrail:credtrail@postgres:5432/credtrail
```

Include the local database file when starting the stack:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.selfhost -f docker-compose.selfhost.yml \
  -f docker-compose.selfhost-postgres.yml up --build --wait
```

This file adds Postgres with a health check and makes migrations wait for it. Postgres runs on the
internal Compose network; it does not publish a database port on your host. The API and worker use
the same `DATABASE_URL` as migrations.

Postgres records use the named volume `postgres-data`. Docker Compose prefixes its name with the
project name. Keep the same project name and include the local database file when restarting or
upgrading so the stack reuses its data. To stop this stack and preserve the database, run:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.selfhost -f docker-compose.selfhost.yml \
  -f docker-compose.selfhost-postgres.yml down
```

The next `up` reuses the database volume. For this local setup, `down --volumes` deletes the local
database; it does not delete objects from your external bucket. Keep regular database and bucket
backups.

### Configure production identity and email

The Compose stack leaves outbound email disabled. Configure email delivery before offering
production email sign-in or invitations.

Do not use `APP_ENV=development` for real self-host installs. Development mode enables local
debugging behavior such as single-use database connections and development auth shortcuts.

Before using the compose stack beyond local validation, replace the sample `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
with a stable random value and set `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` to the public HTTPS origin for
the deployment.

For outbound email, the Node self-host runtime supports `EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses`. Configure AWS
credentials with SES send permissions and verify `TRANSACTIONAL_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` in SES before
enabling magic-link, password-reset, invite, or issuance emails. If `EMAIL_PROVIDER` is omitted,
email delivery is disabled; configure SES before offering production email sign-in or invitations.

Production SES example:

The current SES adapter uses the same AWS credential variables as storage. This example requires
AWS credentials with both S3 and SES permissions. R2 API credentials cannot authenticate SES.

```yaml
EMAIL_PROVIDER: ses
AWS_SES_REGION: us-east-1
TRANSACTIONAL_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS: no-reply@example.edu
```

Cloudflare `EMAIL` and `AI` bindings are SaaS/Workers-only. Self-hosted installs should upload
badge artwork manually; badge image generation is unavailable until a Node AI/image provider is
added.

Validation checks:

- API health: `GET /healthz`
- Dependency readiness: `GET /healthz/dependencies`
- OB3 discovery: `GET /ims/ob/v3p0/discovery`

## Postgres Guidance

- Supported: Postgres 14+
- Recommended: managed Postgres with connection pooling (`pgBouncer` or provider equivalent)
- Backups:
  - logical backup: `pg_dump --format=custom --file=credtrail.dump "$DATABASE_URL"`
  - restore: `pg_restore --clean --if-exists --dbname "$DATABASE_URL" credtrail.dump`

## TLS Termination

Terminate TLS at your edge/load balancer (ALB, NGINX, Traefik, ingress controller).

Required forwarded headers:

- `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`
- `X-Forwarded-Host: <institution-domain>` (include the public port when it is not the default)
- `X-Forwarded-For`: append the real client address to a sanitized address chain

Set `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` to the actual socket addresses or narrow CIDRs of your controlled
proxies, for example `192.0.2.10/32,2001:db8:1::10/128` (documentation-only sample addresses).
Forwarded origin and client-IP headers are ignored by default. Trust is rooted in the socket peer;
CredTrail walks the address chain from the proxy toward the client and stops at the first untrusted
address. The proxy must overwrite forwarded protocol/host and safely append or sanitize the address
chain. Do not trust a whole shared container network that also includes clients or its client gateway.
Node ignores caller-supplied Cloudflare IP headers. The Worker runtime uses only its validated
Cloudflare edge IP. Missing transport identity uses the shared unknown rate-limit bucket.

Loopback HTTP GET/HEAD probes for `/healthz` and `/healthz/dependencies` are supported in
production Node containers even when `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN` uses HTTPS. Other paths and origins
retain canonical redirects. Forwarded origin normalization preserves POST bodies, cookies and
request cancellation before CSRF/authentication middleware runs.

Set `PLATFORM_DOMAIN` to the hostname used for issuer identifiers and credential identity. Do not
include a scheme, path, or port. Set `PUBLIC_APP_ORIGIN` to the one externally reachable app origin,
such as `https://credentials.example.edu`. CredTrail uses that origin for redirects, login, LTI,
emails, badge artwork, and other public app URLs; it does not infer these URLs from request headers.

## Packaged UI assets and production acceptance

The final image includes generated UI CSS, JavaScript and fonts at `/app/public/assets/ui`.
The Node adapter resolves this directory from its installed bundle, independently of the current
working directory. It serves GET/HEAD only, enforces real-path containment (including symlinks),
and returns accurate content types with `nosniff`. Content-hashed files receive immutable year-long
caching; any unversioned assets receive a bounded one-hour cache. The current font is content-hashed.
Asset responses pass through the same Hono middleware as app routes, including canonical-origin
checks, security headers, request IDs and request logging. Missing assets receive those policies too.

Run the production acceptance driver after building an image:

```bash
docker build -t credtrail-selfhost:test .
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps chromium
node scripts/selfhost-production-smoke.mjs --image credtrail-selfhost:test
```

The driver owns disposable Postgres, S3, API/worker, network and TLS proxy resources and removes
them on exit. CI runs this same driver for the production HTTP contracts. Both API and worker
run in production on Node 24. It checks database/storage health, S3 immutable writes/read/metadata/
deletion, discovery, real login CSS/JS/fonts and their HTTP policies/logs, the browser login script,
TLS POST and CSRF behavior, spoof-resistant client IP limits, the namespace route, lifecycle jobs,
queued issuance identity and replay, and active/revoked status lists.
Its browser uses a nonexistent recipient so it sends no email. A Postgres integration test separately
records actual production magic-link delivery in memory and verifies the confirmation/consumption
flow and secure cookie. No real mailbox is contacted by either check.

CI also verifies both shipped Compose configurations with `scripts/selfhost-compose-smoke.mjs`.
The check uses the built image in isolated projects without published host ports. It tests the
default stack against an external disposable Postgres server with certificate-verified TLS, then
tests the optional local Postgres file. A disposable S3 emulator represents an external bucket.
The check uses only disposable credentials and does not read `.env.selfhost` or contact your cloud
services. It verifies migrations, API readiness, queue processing without a queue token, certificate
hostname rejection, database retention, and access to the same object through a normal `down`/`up`
cycle. It removes its own test resources when finished. This check does not validate a live RDS,
AWS S3, or R2 account. Run it locally after building:

```bash
node scripts/selfhost-compose-smoke.mjs --image credtrail-selfhost:test
```

Offline signature acceptance uses released `jsonld-signatures` 11.6.0, `@digitalbazaar/data-integrity`
2.5.0 and `@digitalbazaar/eddsa-rdfc-2022-cryptosuite` 1.3.0 as test-only dependencies. Base and
full TrustEd fixtures use authoritative VC v2, OB3 3.0.3 and status v1 context documents with SHA-256
provenance under `packages/core-domain/src/contexts`; tests also reject altered signed content.

The extension vocabulary identifier remains `https://credtrail.org/ns/trusted-credential/v1` on
self-hosted credentials. The app provides an unauthenticated GET/HEAD route returning its signing
context as `application/ld+json` with public caching and an ETag. After an authorized release, verify
that the canonical public URL serves that same document; local smoke success does not establish
public deployment. Do not rewrite existing immutable signed credentials.

## Upgrade Procedure (Image Tag N -> N+1)

1. Pull new image tag:
   - `docker pull ghcr.io/longsightgroup/credtrail-app:<N+1>`
2. Run database migrations before switching traffic:
   - Use the `migrate` service pattern from `docker-compose.selfhost.yml`.
3. Start new app + worker containers with identical env vars.
4. Confirm:
   - `GET /healthz/dependencies` returns `200`.
   - queue worker logs show successful `node_queue_worker_tick` events.
5. Shift traffic to new app container.
6. Keep previous image tag `<N>` available for rollback.

## Rollback Procedure

1. Stop the `<N+1>` app and worker containers.
2. Start containers using previous tag `<N>`.
3. Verify `/healthz/dependencies`.
4. If migration incompatibility is discovered, restore from backup made before upgrade.

## Troubleshooting

- `DATABASE_URL is required`:
  - missing/empty env var; verify secret injection.
- Postgres connection refused / timeout:
  - database host unreachable or firewall block.
  - verify DNS, network policies, and TLS mode for managed Postgres.
- `S3_BUCKET is required` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID is required`:
  - required object storage env var missing.
- storage dependency check returns 503:
  - verify `S3_ENDPOINT`, credentials, bucket existence, and path-style config.
- queue worker logs `node_queue_worker_error`:
  - inspect the logged `detail` field, then verify database/storage credentials
    and queued job payloads.
  - the Node queue worker processes jobs in-process; it does not call
    `/v1/jobs/process` or use `JOB_PROCESSOR_TOKEN`.
- migration failures:
  - run migrations with `-v ON_ERROR_STOP=1` and inspect the first failing statement.
